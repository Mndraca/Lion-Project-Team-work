        <h1 class="african">What is the African lion?</h1>
        <p>It is the second-largest living big cat after the tiger. 
          Males are unique among the cat species for their thick mane of brown or black hair encircling their head and neck. 
          The mane darkens with age, and the thicker and darker a mane is the healthier the cat. 
          Both males and females roar — a sound heard as far as 8 kilometers away.</p>

            <h4>Mitigate human-wildlife conflict.</h4>
            <p>
              Retaliation is the primary reason people kill this big cat. We work
              with communities to help them realize the big cat's value and to help
              them protect their families and livestock from carnivore predation. In
              Ruaha National Park, where 10 percent of the world's remaining lion
              population can be found, AWF's Ruaha Carnivore Project is fostering a
              much-needed shift in the local opinion of carnivores. Since 2012, AWF
              has been working with Ruaha's communities to build livestock
              enclosures to protect livestock from predation, and, in turn, protect
              big cats and other carnivores from conflict with humans. In addition,
              Ruaha Carnivore Project provides community benefits to villages that
              demonstrate success in living peacefully with carnivores.
            </p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="solutions2">
            <h4>Use scientific research and data.</h4>
            <p>
              African Wildlife Foundation's researchers are working to gain an
              understanding of carnivores' populations, behaviors, movements, and
              interactions with people in order to develop appropriate conservation
              actions. Since 2002, our Large Carnivore Research Project has
              undertaken research aimed at ensuring the continued survival of large
              predators living around Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. There
              are few regions as important to the viability of lion populations as
              the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem. Halting the decline of lion
              populations in this region is imperative to the long-term success of
              the species. The African Wildlife Foundation partners with the
              Tarangire Lion Research Initiative to compile data from the local lion
              population. This data helps us better understand the demographic
              composition of lions in the landscape and pinpoint areas of potential
              threat to the species. To mitigate human-lion conflict, AWF has
              designed and constructed predator-proof enclosures for herdsmen to
              protect their cattle from lion attacks and hosts ongoing education and
              awareness programs to inform the community about safeguarding their
              livestock. As a result of AWF and community efforts, there has not
              been a single retaliatory killing in the landscape since March 2018.

            <h4>Tracking cats for conservation</h4>
            <p>
              With the continental population decreasing and threats continuing to
              mount, it's become more important than ever to closely track this
              species. In Tanzania's Manyara Ranch, AWF tagged the lions with
              high-tech collars equipped with radio transmitters to track the
              animals' natural movements. This allows scientists and
              conservationists to monitor for potential disease outbreaks, home
              range, productivity, behavior, habitat use, survival, predator-prey
              interactions, and ultimately population estimates.

          <h3>They are the most social cats.</h3>
        <hr>
        </hr>
          <p>
            While most cat species are solitary, this big cat is an exception. It
            has developed a social system based on teamwork, division of labor, and
            an extended family unit. The average pride consists of about 15
            individuals, with five to 10 females, their young, and two or three
            territorial males. These are usually brothers or pride mates who have
            formed a coalition to protect their females.
          </p>
          <h3>They are affectionate.</h3>
          <hr>
        </hr>
          <p>
            When resting, which may be up to 20 hours a day, these cats seem to
            enjoy good fellowship with lots of touching, head rubbing, licking, and
            purring.
          </p>
          <h3>Their parenting styles are wildly different.</h3>
          <hr>
        </hr>
          <p>
            Usually, two or more females in a pride give birth around the same time,
            and the cubs are raised together. Some mothers carefully nurture their
            young and will even permit other lion cubs other to suckle, sometimes
            enabling a neglected infant to survive. However, at times, a female may
            also neglect or abandon her cubs, especially if food is scarce.

        <div id="diet">
          <h1>Diet</h1>
          <h3>African lions are both hunters and scavengers.</h3>
          <hr>
        </hr>
          <p>
            Antelope, zebra, and wildebeests are common prey for this big cat.
            However, scavenged food provides more than 50 percent of their
            diets—these big cats will often take over kills made by other
            carnivores—and cooperative hunting enables them to take down prey as
            large as buffaloes, rhinos, hippos, and giraffes. The female does 85 to
            90 percent of the hunting, usually by setting up an ambush for its prey.
            The kill is not shared equally within a pride, and at times of prey
            scarcity, cubs might experience higher mortality rates as hungry females
            may not even share with their offspring.
